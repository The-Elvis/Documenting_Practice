## ðŸ›’ Olist E-Commerce SQL Analysis

## Project Overview
This is a mini analysis carried out on a Brazilian E-commerce store to practice relational database querying. That is to say, the analysis will be carried out purely with MySQL. In this analysis, I will be looking at the sales, product category, seller and customer insights that can help optimize the business.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Explore the Olist dataset using SQL.

- Identify top sellers and their contribution to total revenue.

- Analyze revenue distribution across product categories.

- Investigate customer repeat purchase behavior(Later).

- Track revenue growth patterns over time(Later).

## Dataset and Source

- **Name:** Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist
  
- **Source:** [Kaggle -- Olist E-Commerce Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce)

- **Description:**
  - Covers orders placed from 4th September 2016 to 17th October 2018.
  - Includes 97k+ Orders With details on customers, sellers, product category, payments, reviews and delivery perfomance.
  - Multiple tables are related by order_id, customer_id, product_id and seller_id.
 
## Tools Used

- **SQL** (MySQL)

## EDA and Key Queries

1. **Dataset Overview**

   - Number of Sellers: 3,033
   -  Number of Distinct Orders: 97,256
   -  Number of Items Sold: 111,023
   -  Number of Products Categories: 77
  
       ```sql
         select count(distinct seller_id), 
          count(distinct order_id),
         count(product_id),  
        count(distinct product_category_name)
        from order_items2;
      ```

   - Number of Customers: 99,441

     ```sql
     select count(distinct customer_id)
     from olist_customers_dataset o
     ```
  - Total Sales Revenue In BRL/R$: 13,406,593.940013679

    ```sql
        select SUM(price) total_sales_Revenue 
        from order_items2;
    ```
    
2. **Top Sellers by Revenue:**

   - **Top 10 Sellers:**
   
     Total revenue for the top 10 sellers(In BRL/R$) is 1,787,241.739999. This reperesents 13.33% of the total revenue generated. In essence, top 0.33% of the sellers             generates 13.33% of the total revenue. While this is significant, it also shows that to an extent, Olist is not heavily reliant on the top few sellers. Based on this          alone, sales are somewhat spread out.

   ```sql
   select sum(sales_revenue) total_top10_rev
   from 
	 (select seller_id, count(order_id) sales_volume, SUM(price) sales_Revenue 
	 from order_items2
	 group by seller_id
	 order by 3 desc
	 limit 10
		) as top10;
    ```

   ```sql
    select SUM(price) total_sales_Revenue, 1787241.739999988 * 100/SUM(price)
    from order_items2;
    ```

   - **Top 100 Sellers:**

   The top 100 contributed 45.37% of the total revenue. From this analysis, we see that even the top 100 sellers do not make up half of the revenue. Out of 3,033 sellers,       2,933 account for 55%. This shows that the store's sales revenue is spread out meaning, if one top seller leaves, the impact on revenue will be limited. It highlights       that the long tail of smaller sellers is really the back bone here. Supporting these smaller sellers, for example, by increasing their visibility, will go a long way 		in boosting overall revenue.

   ```sql
   select sum(sales_revenue) total_top100_rev
   from 
	(select seller_id, count(order_id) sales_volume, SUM(price) sales_Revenue 
	from order_items2
	group by seller_id
	order by 3 desc
	limit 100
		) as top100; 
    ```

```sql
  select SUM(price) total_sales_Revenue, 6083000.989999993 * 100/SUM(price)
  from order_items2;
  ```
   
And to further cement the above insight, I carried out a cumulative revenue calculation by seller using window function, attached below is the query.

```sql
	select seller_id,
	   sum(price) total_revenue,
	   sum(sum(price)) over (order by sum(price) desc) cumulative_revenue,
	   round(
	   		sum(sum(price)) over (order by sum(price) desc)
	   		/sum(sum(price)) over() * 100, 2
	   		) as cumulative_pct
	from order_items2
	group by seller_id
	order by 2 desc;
```

This allowed me to rank the sellers by revenue contribution and compute the cumulative share across all 3,033 sellers.
